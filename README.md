# emailSpamFilter

In this project, I construct a spam email filter! The filter will be able to take a dataframe of emails, and based on their content, use supervised machine learning methods - Logistic Regression, One Hot Encoding, etc - to predict whether the emails are spam or not (I call the latter "ham" emails).
